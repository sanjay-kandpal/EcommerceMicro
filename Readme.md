# Running Dockerized Ecommerce Microservices on a Different System

To run your Dockerized microservice application on a different system, follow these steps:

## 1. Ensure Docker is Installed

Make sure Docker is installed on the target system. You can install Docker by following the official [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## 2. Transfer the Docker Image

You have two options for transferring the Docker image to the target system:

### Option 1: Use a Docker Registry

1. **Push the Image to a Docker Registry:**
   - Tag your image with the registry's address:
     ```bash
     docker tag your-service-name:latest your-registry/your-service-name:latest
     ```
   - Log in to the registry (if necessary):
     ```bash
     docker login your-registry
     ```
   - Push the image:
     ```bash
     docker push your-registry/your-service-name:latest
     ```

2. **Pull the Image on the Target System:**
   - Log in to the registry on the target system:
     ```bash
     docker login your-registry
     ```
   - Pull the image:
     ```bash
     docker pull your-registry/your-service-name:latest
     ```

3. **Run the Docker Container:**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 your-registry/your-service-name:latest
